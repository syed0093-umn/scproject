I don't know whether it's an autistic sensory thing, but I can't stand plain water or anything more warm and/or bitter. If I try to force myself to drink nothing but water, I will dehydrate myself to a dangerous degree. The warm/cold and bitter/sweet scale seems to be linked. Warm milk or hot chocolate? Also right out. Most preparations of tea or coffee. Too bitter. Sweet iced tea great but also calorie dense, unsweetened undrinkable, green tea of any kind undrinkable. I'm experimenting with iced coffee, trying to develop a taste for coffee, as that seems to be the closest to breaking through and would be a source of caffeine which I'm addicted to in the traditional sense (weeks of headaches if I try to stop, still end up lethargic all the time even months after stopping).\n\nBasically the only things that work for me are fruit juices (actual fruit juice, not smoothies or a lemon slice in water), sweet tea (half the calories of soda, can have caffeine), artificial sweeteners (though studies have shown that somehow doesn't help with weight loss, likely due to increasing hunger), sweet drink mixes and liquid fruit flavorings for water. I'll still try to weave in plain cold filtered water whenever I feel up to it, but there's no way I could survive on that alone. I've tried, I end up with headaches, dizziness, and kidney stones.\n\nTLDR: \"Sweet drinks are unhealthy, here's a middle ground alternative: bitter drinks\" isn't actually helpful. There is some middle ground to help step down from pure soda. Even if that middle ground isn't ideal, being half as bad is still a significant improvement.",

I don't know whether it's an autistic sensory thing, but I can't stand plain water or anything more warm and/or bitter. If I try to force myself to drink nothing but water, I will dehydrate myself to a dangerous degree. The warm/cold and bitter/sweet scale seems to be linked. Warm milk or hot chocolate? Also right out. Most preparations of tea or coffee. Too bitter. Sweet iced tea great but also calorie dense, unsweetened undrinkable, green tea of any kind undrinkable. I'm experimenting with iced coffee, trying to develop a taste for coffee, as that seems to be the closest to breaking through and would be a source of caffeine which I'm addicted to in the traditional sense (weeks of headaches if I try to stop, still end up lethargic all the time even months after stopping).\n\nBasically the only things that work for me are fruit juices (actual fruit juice, not smoothies or a lemon slice in water), sweet tea (half the calories of soda, can have caffeine), artificial sweeteners (though studies have shown that somehow doesn't help with weight loss, likely due to increasing hunger), sweet drink mixes and liquid fruit flavorings for water. I'll still try to weave in plain cold filtered water whenever I feel up to it, but there's no way I could survive on that alone. I've tried, I end up with headaches, dizziness, and kidney stones.\n\nTLDR: \"Sweet drinks are unhealthy, here's a middle ground alternative: bitter drinks\" isn't actually helpful. There is some middle ground to help step down from pure soda. Even if that middle ground isn't ideal, being half as bad is still a significant improvement.",

If I try to force myself to drink nothing but water, I will dehydrate myself to a dangerous degree. The warm/cold and bitter/sweet scale seems to be linked. Warm milk or hot chocolate? Also right out. Most preparations of tea or coffee. Too bitter. Sweet iced tea great but also calorie dense, unsweetened undrinkable, green tea of any kind undrinkable. I'm experimenting with iced coffee, trying to develop a taste for coffee, as that seems to be the closest to breaking through and would be a source of caffeine which I'm addicted to in the traditional sense (weeks of headaches if I try to stop, still end up lethargic all the time even months after stopping).\n\nBasically the only things that work for me are fruit juices (actual fruit juice, not smoothies or a lemon slice in water), sweet tea (half the calories of soda, can have caffeine), artificial sweeteners (though studies have shown that somehow doesn't help with weight loss, likely due to increasing hunger), sweet drink mixes and liquid fruit flavorings for water. I'll still try to weave in plain cold filtered water whenever I feel up to it, but there's no way I could survive on that alone. I've tried, I end up with headaches, dizziness, and kidney stones.\n\nTLDR: \"Sweet drinks are unhealthy, here's a middle ground alternative: bitter drinks\" isn't actually helpful. There is some middle ground to help step down from pure soda. Even if that middle ground isn't ideal, being half as bad is still a significant improvement.",

They're *already* calling to deport people who criticize trump (see the lady preacher during inaugural prayers). \n\n2. Congress has been shouting that those like Tlaib and AOC aren't american enough and should be deported. Both have been told to 'go back where you came from'. \n\n3. SCOTUS ruled trumps immune from accountability for illegal actions so long as those actions were taken while being president. \n\n4. Trump says to deport americans, congress doesnt stop it, SCOTUS nulls lower courts opinions, and Americans are deported. \n\nFYI this happened to more than SEVENTY americans during trumps first term. He ALREADY deported citizens, both citizens by birth and by naturalization.",

Government economic numbers supplied by the Bureau of Labor Statistics do not reflect a great economic environment during Biden's administration.  While inflation rate has dropped, it is cumulative in nature, so that peak level of 9.1% in 2022, resulted in a high Consumer Price Index (CPI) amount. The Consumer Price Index incorporates 8 major consumer spending groups: Food/Beverages, Transportation, Medical Care, Recreation, Housing, Apparel, Education/Communication,\u00a0 and Other Goods and Services.\u00a0That level still remains high and explains why many households are financially struggling. Throw in the open border policy which resulted in millions of illegal immigrants coming into the US and getting financial assistance, while some  US citizens were in economic distress. It is a no brainer that this would cause resentment. \n\nI have family who are registered (moderate) Democrats who are unhappy with the take over of the party by more radical left wing ideas and policies.  They did not vote for Harris, because she represented a continuation of the economic and open border policies. Like I previously posted, Democrats need to step back and assess how they lost their voting base and also have candidates who will engage with voters to find out their needs and concerns. The focus needs to be on mainstream people as the fringe groups are apparently not enough to win a White House.",

They\u2019re sure talking like they\u2019re taking it seriously:\n\n> Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Tuesday that the Trump administration would \"have to make a decision\" on whether to pursue El Salvadorian President Nayib Bukele's offer to accept convicted American criminals and U.S. permanent residents in the Central American country's prisons and President Donald Trump suggested, if legal, he'd \"do it in a heartbeat.\"\n\n> \"There are obviously legalities involved. We have a Constitution, we have all sorts of things, but it's a very generous offer,\" Rubio said during a news conference in Costa Rica on Tuesday.\n\n> \"No one's ever made an offer like that -- to outsource, at a fraction of the cost at least some of the most dangerous and violent criminals that we have in the United States,\"\n\n> Trump was bullish when asked about the offer at the White House later Tuesday.\n\n> \"These are sick people. If we could get them out of our country, we have other countries that would take him. They could,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t  be too surprising, of course, given their government, but there\u2019s probably a reason none of the hellhole governments we\u2019ve installed and propped up have made a similar offer.

Government economic numbers supplied by the Bureau of Labor Statistics do not reflect a great economic environment during Biden's administration.  While inflation rate has dropped, it is cumulative in nature, so that peak level of 9.1% in 2022, resulted in a high Consumer Price Index (CPI) amount. The Consumer Price Index incorporates 8 major consumer spending groups: Food/Beverages, Transportation, Medical Care, Recreation, Housing, Apparel, Education/Communication,\u00a0 and Other Goods and Services.\u00a0That level still remains high and explains why many households are financially struggling. Throw in the open border policy which resulted in millions of illegal immigrants coming into the US and getting financial assistance, while some  US citizens were in economic distress. It is a no brainer that this would cause resentment. \n\nI have family who are registered (moderate) Democrats who are unhappy with the take over of the party by more radical left wing ideas and policies.  They did not vote for Harris, because she represented a continuation of the economic and open border policies. Like I previously posted, Democrats need to step back and assess how they lost their voting base and also have candidates who will engage with voters to find out their needs and concerns. The focus needs to be on mainstream people as the fringe groups are apparently not enough to win a White House.",

    "comment_body": "Obviously pure soda is one of the most calorie-dense drinks. I don't know whether it's an autistic sensory thing, but I can't stand plain water or anything more warm and/or bitter. If I try to force myself to drink nothing but water, I will dehydrate myself to a dangerous degree. The warm/cold and bitter/sweet scale seems to be linked. Warm milk or hot chocolate? Also right out. Most preparations of tea or coffee. Too bitter. Sweet iced tea great but also calorie dense, unsweetened undrinkable, green tea of any kind undrinkable. I'm experimenting with iced coffee, trying to develop a taste for coffee, as that seems to be the closest to breaking through and would be a source of caffeine which I'm addicted to in the traditional sense (weeks of headaches if I try to stop, still end up lethargic all the time even months after stopping).\n\nBasically the only things that work for me are fruit juices (actual fruit juice, not smoothies or a lemon slice in water), sweet tea (half the calories of soda, can have caffeine), artificial sweeteners (though studies have shown that somehow doesn't help with weight loss, likely due to increasing hunger), sweet drink mixes and liquid fruit flavorings for water. I'll still try to weave in plain cold filtered water whenever I feel up to it, but there's no way I could survive on that alone. I've tried, I end up with headaches, dizziness, and kidney stones.\n\nTLDR: \"Sweet drinks are unhealthy, here's a middle ground alternative: bitter drinks\" isn't actually helpful. There is some middle ground to help step down from pure soda. Even if that middle ground isn't ideal, being half as bad is still a significant improvement.",

We don't need genetic variety in apes to see the truth of the infinite monkey theorem - we only need to look at the research discussed in the article. Authors claim an individual chimpanzee would have a 5% chance of typing the word 'banana' in its lifetime.

We don't need genetic variety in apes to see the truth of the infinite monkey theorem - we only need to look at the research discussed in the article. Authors claim an individual chimpanzee would have a 5% chance of typing the word 'banana' in its lifetime.

I don't know whether it's an autistic sensory thing, but I can't stand plain water or anything more warm and/or bitter. If I try to force myself to drink nothing but water, I will dehydrate myself to a dangerous degree. The warm/cold and bitter/sweet scale seems to be linked. Warm milk or hot chocolate? Also right out. Most preparations of tea or coffee. Too bitter. Sweet iced tea great but also calorie dense, unsweetened undrinkable, green tea of any kind undrinkable. I'm experimenting with iced coffee, trying to develop a taste for coffee, as that seems to be the closest to breaking through and would be a source of caffeine which I'm addicted to in the traditional sense (weeks of headaches if I try to stop, still end up lethargic all the time even months after stopping).\n\nBasically the only things that work for me are fruit juices (actual fruit juice, not smoothies or a lemon slice in water), sweet tea (half the calories of soda, can have caffeine), artificial sweeteners (though studies have shown that somehow doesn't help with weight loss, likely due to increasing hunger), sweet drink mixes and liquid fruit flavorings for water. I'll still try to weave in plain cold filtered water whenever I feel up to it, but there's no way I could survive on that alone. I've tried, I end up with headaches, dizziness, and kidney stones.\n\nTLDR: \"Sweet drinks are unhealthy, here's a middle ground alternative: bitter drinks\" isn't actually helpful. There is some middle ground to help step down from pure soda. Even if that middle ground isn't ideal, being half as bad is still a significant improvement.",

I don't know whether it's an autistic sensory thing, but I can't stand plain water or anything more warm and/or bitter. If I try to force myself to drink nothing but water, I will dehydrate myself to a dangerous degree. The warm/cold and bitter/sweet scale seems to be linked. Warm milk or hot chocolate? Also right out. Most preparations of tea or coffee. Too bitter. Sweet iced tea great but also calorie dense, unsweetened undrinkable, green tea of any kind undrinkable. I'm experimenting with iced coffee, trying to develop a taste for coffee, as that seems to be the closest to breaking through and would be a source of caffeine which I'm addicted to in the traditional sense (weeks of headaches if I try to stop, still end up lethargic all the time even months after stopping).\n\nBasically the only things that work for me are fruit juices (actual fruit juice, not smoothies or a lemon slice in water), sweet tea (half the calories of soda, can have caffeine), artificial sweeteners (though studies have shown that somehow doesn't help with weight loss, likely due to increasing hunger), sweet drink mixes and liquid fruit flavorings for water. I'll still try to weave in plain cold filtered water whenever I feel up to it, but there's no way I could survive on that alone. I've tried, I end up with headaches, dizziness, and kidney stones.\n\nTLDR: \"Sweet drinks are unhealthy, here's a middle ground alternative: bitter drinks\" isn't actually helpful. There is some middle ground to help step down from pure soda. Even if that middle ground isn't ideal, being half as bad is still a significant improvement.",

Also because they would die of old age, and we don\u2019t have the cloning technology to actually clone infinite Shakespeares. Therefore I challenge this theory on behalf of New Zealandian mathematicians, who will not fall behind the Australians!",

I don't know whether it's an autistic sensory thing, but I can't stand plain water or anything more warm and/or bitter. If I try to force myself to drink nothing but water, I will dehydrate myself to a dangerous degree. The warm/cold and bitter/sweet scale seems to be linked. Warm milk or hot chocolate? Also right out. Most preparations of tea or coffee. Too bitter. Sweet iced tea great but also calorie dense, unsweetened undrinkable, green tea of any kind undrinkable. I'm experimenting with iced coffee, trying to develop a taste for coffee, as that seems to be the closest to breaking through and would be a source of caffeine which I'm addicted to in the traditional sense (weeks of headaches if I try to stop, still end up lethargic all the time even months after stopping).\n\nBasically the only things that work for me are fruit juices (actual fruit juice, not smoothies or a lemon slice in water), sweet tea (half the calories of soda, can have caffeine), artificial sweeteners (though studies have shown that somehow doesn't help with weight loss, likely due to increasing hunger), sweet drink mixes and liquid fruit flavorings for water. I'll still try to weave in plain cold filtered water whenever I feel up to it, but there's no way I could survive on that alone. I've tried, I end up with headaches, dizziness, and kidney stones.\n\nTLDR: \"Sweet drinks are unhealthy, here's a middle ground alternative: bitter drinks\" isn't actually helpful. There is some middle ground to help step down from pure soda. Even if that middle ground isn't ideal, being half as bad is still a significant improvement.",

I don't know whether it's an autistic sensory thing, but I can't stand plain water or anything more warm and/or bitter. If I try to force myself to drink nothing but water, I will dehydrate myself to a dangerous degree. The warm/cold and bitter/sweet scale seems to be linked. Warm milk or hot chocolate? Also right out. Most preparations of tea or coffee. Too bitter. Sweet iced tea great but also calorie dense, unsweetened undrinkable, green tea of any kind undrinkable. I'm experimenting with iced coffee, trying to develop a taste for coffee, as that seems to be the closest to breaking through and would be a source of caffeine which I'm addicted to in the traditional sense (weeks of headaches if I try to stop, still end up lethargic all the time even months after stopping).\n\nBasically the only things that work for me are fruit juices (actual fruit juice, not smoothies or a lemon slice in water), sweet tea (half the calories of soda, can have caffeine), artificial sweeteners (though studies have shown that somehow doesn't help with weight loss, likely due to increasing hunger), sweet drink mixes and liquid fruit flavorings for water. I'll still try to weave in plain cold filtered water whenever I feel up to it, but there's no way I could survive on that alone. I've tried, I end up with headaches, dizziness, and kidney stones.\n\nTLDR: \"Sweet drinks are unhealthy, here's a middle ground alternative: bitter drinks\" isn't actually helpful. There is some middle ground to help step down from pure soda. Even if that middle ground isn't ideal, being half as bad is still a significant improvement.",

I don't know whether it's an autistic sensory thing, but I can't stand plain water or anything more warm and/or bitter. If I try to force myself to drink nothing but water, I will dehydrate myself to a dangerous degree. The warm/cold and bitter/sweet scale seems to be linked. Warm milk or hot chocolate? Also right out. Most preparations of tea or coffee. Too bitter. Sweet iced tea great but also calorie dense, unsweetened undrinkable, green tea of any kind undrinkable. I'm experimenting with iced coffee, trying to develop a taste for coffee, as that seems to be the closest to breaking through and would be a source of caffeine which I'm addicted to in the traditional sense (weeks of headaches if I try to stop, still end up lethargic all the time even months after stopping).\n\nBasically the only things that work for me are fruit juices (actual fruit juice, not smoothies or a lemon slice in water), sweet tea (half the calories of soda, can have caffeine), artificial sweeteners (though studies have shown that somehow doesn't help with weight loss, likely due to increasing hunger), sweet drink mixes and liquid fruit flavorings for water. I'll still try to weave in plain cold filtered water whenever I feel up to it, but there's no way I could survive on that alone. I've tried, I end up with headaches, dizziness, and kidney stones.\n\nTLDR: \"Sweet drinks are unhealthy, here's a middle ground alternative: bitter drinks\" isn't actually helpful. There is some middle ground to help step down from pure soda. Even if that middle ground isn't ideal, being half as bad is still a significant improvement.",

Congress has been shouting that those like Tlaib and AOC aren't american enough and should be deported. Both have been told to 'go back where you came from'. \n\n3. SCOTUS ruled trumps immune from accountability for illegal actions so long as those actions were taken while being president. \n\n4.

Government economic numbers supplied by the Bureau of Labor Statistics do not reflect a great economic environment during Biden's administration.  While inflation rate has dropped, it is cumulative in nature, so that peak level of 9.1% in 2022, resulted in a high Consumer Price Index (CPI) amount. The Consumer Price Index incorporates 8 major consumer spending groups: Food/Beverages, Transportation, Medical Care, Recreation, Housing, Apparel, Education/Communication,\u00a0 and Other Goods and Services.\u00a0That level still remains high and explains why many households are financially struggling. Throw in the open border policy which resulted in millions of illegal immigrants coming into the US and getting financial assistance, while some  US citizens were in economic distress. It is a no brainer that this would cause resentment. \n\nI have family who are registered (moderate) Democrats who are unhappy with the take over of the party by more radical left wing ideas and policies.  They did not vote for Harris, because she represented a continuation of the economic and open border policies. Like I previously posted, Democrats need to step back and assess how they lost their voting base and also have candidates who will engage with voters to find out their needs and concerns. The focus needs to be on mainstream people as the fringe groups are apparently not enough to win a White House.",

Also right out. Most preparations of tea or coffee. Too bitter. Sweet iced tea great but also calorie dense, unsweetened undrinkable, green tea of any kind undrinkable. I'm experimenting with iced coffee, trying to develop a taste for coffee, as that seems to be the closest to breaking through and would be a source of caffeine which I'm addicted to in the traditional sense (weeks of headaches if I try to stop, still end up lethargic all the time even months after stopping).\n\nBasically the only things that work for me are fruit juices (actual fruit juice, not smoothies or a lemon slice in water), sweet tea (half the calories of soda, can have caffeine), artificial sweeteners (though studies have shown that somehow doesn't help with weight loss, likely due to increasing hunger), sweet drink mixes and liquid fruit flavorings for water. I'll still try to weave in plain cold filtered water whenever I feel up to it, but there's no way I could survive on that alone. I've tried, I end up with headaches, dizziness, and kidney stones.\n\nTLDR: \"Sweet drinks are unhealthy, here's a middle ground alternative: bitter drinks\" isn't actually helpful.

We don't need genetic variety in apes to see the truth of the infinite monkey theorem - we only need to look at the research discussed in the article. Authors claim an individual chimpanzee would have a 5% chance of typing the word 'banana' in its lifetime.

We don't need genetic variety in apes to see the truth of the infinite monkey theorem - we only need to look at the research discussed in the article. Authors claim an individual chimpanzee would have a 5% chance of typing the word 'banana' in its lifetime.

I don't know whether it's an autistic sensory thing, but I can't stand plain water or anything more warm and/or bitter. If I try to force myself to drink nothing but water, I will dehydrate myself to a dangerous degree. The warm/cold and bitter/sweet scale seems to be linked. Warm milk or hot chocolate? Also right out. Most preparations of tea or coffee. Too bitter. Sweet iced tea great but also calorie dense, unsweetened undrinkable, green tea of any kind undrinkable. I'm experimenting with iced coffee, trying to develop a taste for coffee, as that seems to be the closest to breaking through and would be a source of caffeine which I'm addicted to in the traditional sense (weeks of headaches if I try to stop, still end up lethargic all the time even months after stopping).\n\nBasically the only things that work for me are fruit juices (actual fruit juice, not smoothies or a lemon slice in water), sweet tea (half the calories of soda, can have caffeine), artificial sweeteners (though studies have shown that somehow doesn't help with weight loss, likely due to increasing hunger), sweet drink mixes and liquid fruit flavorings for water. I'll still try to weave in plain cold filtered water whenever I feel up to it, but there's no way I could survive on that alone. I've tried, I end up with headaches, dizziness, and kidney stones.\n\nTLDR: \"Sweet drinks are unhealthy, here's a middle ground alternative: bitter drinks\" isn't actually helpful. There is some middle ground to help step down from pure soda. Even if that middle ground isn't ideal, being half as bad is still a significant improvement.",

We don't need genetic variety in apes to see the truth of the infinite monkey theorem - we only need to look at the research discussed in the article. Authors claim an individual chimpanzee would have a 5% chance of typing the word 'banana' in its lifetime.

I don't know whether it's an autistic sensory thing, but I can't stand plain water or anything more warm and/or bitter. If I try to force myself to drink nothing but water, I will dehydrate myself to a dangerous degree. The warm/cold and bitter/sweet scale seems to be linked. Warm milk or hot chocolate? Also right out. Most preparations of tea or coffee. Too bitter. Sweet iced tea great but also calorie dense, unsweetened undrinkable, green tea of any kind undrinkable. I'm experimenting with iced coffee, trying to develop a taste for coffee, as that seems to be the closest to breaking through and would be a source of caffeine which I'm addicted to in the traditional sense (weeks of headaches if I try to stop, still end up lethargic all the time even months after stopping).\n\nBasically the only things that work for me are fruit juices (actual fruit juice, not smoothies or a lemon slice in water), sweet tea (half the calories of soda, can have caffeine), artificial sweeteners (though studies have shown that somehow doesn't help with weight loss, likely due to increasing hunger), sweet drink mixes and liquid fruit flavorings for water. I'll still try to weave in plain cold filtered water whenever I feel up to it, but there's no way I could survive on that alone. I've tried, I end up with headaches, dizziness, and kidney stones.\n\nTLDR: \"Sweet drinks are unhealthy, here's a middle ground alternative: bitter drinks\" isn't actually helpful. There is some middle ground to help step down from pure soda. Even if that middle ground isn't ideal, being half as bad is still a significant improvement.",

    "comment_body": "Obviously pure soda is one of the most calorie-dense drinks. I don't know whether it's an autistic sensory thing, but I can't stand plain water or anything more warm and/or bitter. If I try to force myself to drink nothing but water, I will dehydrate myself to a dangerous degree. The warm/cold and bitter/sweet scale seems to be linked. Warm milk or hot chocolate? Also right out. Most preparations of tea or coffee. Too bitter. Sweet iced tea great but also calorie dense, unsweetened undrinkable, green tea of any kind undrinkable. I'm experimenting with iced coffee, trying to develop a taste for coffee, as that seems to be the closest to breaking through and would be a source of caffeine which I'm addicted to in the traditional sense (weeks of headaches if I try to stop, still end up lethargic all the time even months after stopping).\n\nBasically the only things that work for me are fruit juices (actual fruit juice, not smoothies or a lemon slice in water), sweet tea (half the calories of soda, can have caffeine), artificial sweeteners (though studies have shown that somehow doesn't help with weight loss, likely due to increasing hunger), sweet drink mixes and liquid fruit flavorings for water. I'll still try to weave in plain cold filtered water whenever I feel up to it, but there's no way I could survive on that alone. I've tried, I end up with headaches, dizziness, and kidney stones.\n\nTLDR: \"Sweet drinks are unhealthy, here's a middle ground alternative: bitter drinks\" isn't actually helpful. There is some middle ground to help step down from pure soda. Even if that middle ground isn't ideal, being half as bad is still a significant improvement.",

I don't know whether it's an autistic sensory thing, but I can't stand plain water or anything more warm and/or bitter. If I try to force myself to drink nothing but water, I will dehydrate myself to a dangerous degree. The warm/cold and bitter/sweet scale seems to be linked. Warm milk or hot chocolate? Also right out. Most preparations of tea or coffee. Too bitter. Sweet iced tea great but also calorie dense, unsweetened undrinkable, green tea of any kind undrinkable. I'm experimenting with iced coffee, trying to develop a taste for coffee, as that seems to be the closest to breaking through and would be a source of caffeine which I'm addicted to in the traditional sense (weeks of headaches if I try to stop, still end up lethargic all the time even months after stopping).\n\nBasically the only things that work for me are fruit juices (actual fruit juice, not smoothies or a lemon slice in water), sweet tea (half the calories of soda, can have caffeine), artificial sweeteners (though studies have shown that somehow doesn't help with weight loss, likely due to increasing hunger), sweet drink mixes and liquid fruit flavorings for water. I'll still try to weave in plain cold filtered water whenever I feel up to it, but there's no way I could survive on that alone. I've tried, I end up with headaches, dizziness, and kidney stones.\n\nTLDR: \"Sweet drinks are unhealthy, here's a middle ground alternative: bitter drinks\" isn't actually helpful. There is some middle ground to help step down from pure soda. Even if that middle ground isn't ideal, being half as bad is still a significant improvement.",

We don't need genetic variety in apes to see the truth of the infinite monkey theorem - we only need to look at the research discussed in the article. Authors claim an individual chimpanzee would have a 5% chance of typing the word 'banana' in its lifetime.

We don't need genetic variety in apes to see the truth of the infinite monkey theorem - we only need to look at the research discussed in the article. Authors claim an individual chimpanzee would have a 5% chance of typing the word 'banana' in its lifetime.

That just feels like a much more counterintuitive supposition than the one we've seen proved over and over - that genetic variation spits out wild combinations (the survival of the most adaptive of which results in evolution). \n\nI think my view requires fewer assumptions - we often observe individual members of complex simian species varying widely in ability and proclivities whereas there's no evidence I'm aware of that monkeys *always* hit keys according to a pattern. \n\nThe burden would be on you to prove that monkeys, uniquely and for some heretofore unobserved reason, are unable to hit keys randomly.\n\nBut, putting all that aside, I think the article itself refutes your supposition. We don't need genetic variety in apes to see the truth of the infinite monkey theorem - we only need to look at the research discussed in the article. Authors claim an individual chimpanzee would have a 5% chance of typing the word 'banana' in its lifetime. Given that researchers have *already* determined there is a chance for a monkey to randomly type a word, you'd need to refute their research before you could believe that the infinite monkey theorem doesn't apply.",

We don't need genetic variety in apes to see the truth of the infinite monkey theorem - we only need to look at the research discussed in the article. Authors claim an individual chimpanzee would have a 5% chance of typing the word 'banana' in its lifetime. Given that researchers have *already* determined there is a chance for a monkey to randomly type a word, you'd need to refute their research before you could believe that the infinite monkey theorem doesn't apply.",

Authors claim an individual chimpanzee would have a 5% chance of typing the word 'banana' in its lifetime.

I don't know whether it's an autistic sensory thing, but I can't stand plain water or anything more warm and/or bitter. If I try to force myself to drink nothing but water, I will dehydrate myself to a dangerous degree. The warm/cold and bitter/sweet scale seems to be linked. Warm milk or hot chocolate? Also right out. Most preparations of tea or coffee. Too bitter. Sweet iced tea great but also calorie dense, unsweetened undrinkable, green tea of any kind undrinkable. I'm experimenting with iced coffee, trying to develop a taste for coffee, as that seems to be the closest to breaking through and would be a source of caffeine which I'm addicted to in the traditional sense (weeks of headaches if I try to stop, still end up lethargic all the time even months after stopping).\n\nBasically the only things that work for me are fruit juices (actual fruit juice, not smoothies or a lemon slice in water), sweet tea (half the calories of soda, can have caffeine), artificial sweeteners (though studies have shown that somehow doesn't help with weight loss, likely due to increasing hunger), sweet drink mixes and liquid fruit flavorings for water. I'll still try to weave in plain cold filtered water whenever I feel up to it, but there's no way I could survive on that alone. I've tried, I end up with headaches, dizziness, and kidney stones.\n\nTLDR: \"Sweet drinks are unhealthy, here's a middle ground alternative: bitter drinks\" isn't actually helpful. There is some middle ground to help step down from pure soda. Even if that middle ground isn't ideal, being half as bad is still a significant improvement.",

That just feels like a much more counterintuitive supposition than the one we've seen proved over and over - that genetic variation spits out wild combinations (the survival of the most adaptive of which results in evolution). \n\nI think my view requires fewer assumptions - we often observe individual members of complex simian species varying widely in ability and proclivities whereas there's no evidence I'm aware of that monkeys *always* hit keys according to a pattern. \n\nThe burden would be on you to prove that monkeys, uniquely and for some heretofore unobserved reason, are unable to hit keys randomly.\n\nBut, putting all that aside, I think the article itself refutes your supposition. We don't need genetic variety in apes to see the truth of the infinite monkey theorem - we only need to look at the research discussed in the article. Authors claim an individual chimpanzee would have a 5% chance of typing the word 'banana' in its lifetime. Given that researchers have *already* determined there is a chance for a monkey to randomly type a word, you'd need to refute their research before you could believe that the infinite monkey theorem doesn't apply.",

Also because they would die of old age, and we don\u2019t have the cloning technology to actually clone infinite Shakespeares. Therefore I challenge this theory on behalf of New Zealandian mathematicians, who will not fall behind the Australians!",
